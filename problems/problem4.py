# Largest palindrome product
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# test number for palindromicity
# go to next number
